These objects were built to work with Max/MSP 5 on Snow Leopard.  
I've also included the source which includes XCode projects for building them on another machine.  

jd.derivation takes the derivative of one dimensional velocity values.  You specify the number of frames to average and it gives you back the velocity, acceleration, and jerk over this timeperiod.
jd.ringave computes a running average of incoming numbers over x-frames.  
jd.ringdiff computes the average difference of incoming numbers over x-frames.

I built these objects while experimenting with a motion tracking controller.
